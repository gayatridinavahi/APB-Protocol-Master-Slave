# APB-Protocol-Master-Slave
This repository contains the design files of both the master and slave. It also includes the integration of both, and an external register bank. The verification of the design with test cases of continuous reads and writes, writing to a read-only register and reading a write-only register.

### Introduction
**AMBA**
    The AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) is an open standard bus protocol developed by ARM for designing complex System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. It provides a framework and specifications for 
    efficient communication and integration of IP components within a SoC. The architecture includes buses like AHB, ASB, APB, and AXI, each catering to specific requirements in terms of performance and 
    complexity. AMBA promotes modularity and reusability, simplifying the development of embedded systems in various domains.

**ABP**
    Developed by ARM, the APB protocol provides a low-power, low-complexity interface for connecting peripheral devices to a microprocessor or microcontroller. The AMBA APB protocol is designed to address the 
    specific requirements of peripheral devices that operate at slower speeds and do not require high bandwidth. It is commonly used to connect peripheral devices such as timers, interrupt controllers, UARTs 
    (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitters), and other low-speed peripherals to the system bus. The AMBA APB protocol serves as a crucial interface protocol for connecting peripheral devices in SoC 
    designs. Its simplicity, low power consumption, and widespread adoption have made it a popular choice in the industry.

### Signal Description
• PCLK Clock: The rising edge of PCLK times all transfers on the APB.

• PRESET: System bus equivalent Reset. The APB reset signal is active LOW.

• PADDR: 32-bit address bus

• PSEL: The slave device is selected and that a data transfer is required.

• PENABLE: Enable, this signal indicates the second and subsequent cycles of an APB transfer.

• PWRITE: control bit to dictate read or write operation.

• PWDATA: 32 bits Write data if PWRITE is HIGH.

• PREADY: Ready To extend an APB transfer.

• PRDATA: 32 bits Read data if PWRITE is LOW.

• PSLVERR: Slave error, this signal indicates a transfer failure.

#### Operating States
**IDLE** This is the default state of the APB.

**SETUP** When a transfer is required the bus moves into the SETUP state, where
the appropriate select signal, PSELx, is asserted. The bus only remains
in the SETUP state for one clock cycle and always moves to the ACCESS
state on the next rising edge of the clock.

**ACCESS** The enable signal, PENABLE, is asserted in the ACCESS state. The
           address, write, select, and write data signals must remain stable during
           the transition from the SETUP to ACCESS state.
           Exit from the ACCESS state is controlled by the PREADY signal from
           the slave.           
### Results
The waveform generated has been verified for the following scenarios:
 1) Read-Write registers
 2) Read-Only register
 3) Write only register
 4) Continuous reads and writes
